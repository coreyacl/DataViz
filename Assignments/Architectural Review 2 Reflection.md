# Architectural 2 Reflection

### Feedback and Decisions
Feedback:
We asked for advice on extracting and compiling data more smoothly, and we were told to use Pandas to solve our compiling issues. We have since learned to use Pandas and it has proved effective.

We also asked for feedback on the types of graphs and their appearance. Our audience suggested to use a treemap for population instead of a bubble chart. They also suggested that we get help from our classmates on constructing a map of the US. In terms of aesthetics of the graphs, we were told that altair is a data visualization library that we could use. From this information, we have decided to use our intended bubble graph, considering that we only want to represent one occupation individually, instead of all the occupations at once. For the map of the U.S., the classmates we asked about it suggested that we use Bokeh. Therefore, we are still deciding which library to use.  

For questions relating to the UI, we were told that our idea of using a chalkboard style background could be interesting, but it our audience did not think it was an important factor for the overall project. We were also advised to clearly come up with a unified goal for the project and that would make figuring out which graphs to include as well as other design choices easier. Right after the session, we thought of a unified goal and it has solidified our decisions on which graphs to use. 

### Review Process Reflection:
The review went less smoothly than we have hoped and planned. We could have written the questions and suggestions that were mentioned during the presentation. Most of our audience was confused on what the final end goal of our project. We individually presented aspects of the project but failed to address the overall objective of the project. In the future, we will state the main goal for our project in the beginning of the presentation.
