# Architectural 2 Reflection

### Feedback and Decisions


### Review Process Reflection:
The review went smoothly as we have hoped and planned. We could have written the questions and suggestions that were mentioned during the presentation. Most of our audience was confused on what the final end goal of our project. We individually presented aspects of the project but failed to address the overall objective of the project. In the future, we will state the main goal for our project in the beginning of the presentation.
