# Occupation Visualization Architecture Review 2
### *Corey Cochran-Lepiz, Junwon Lee, and Alli Busa*

## 1. Background and Context
We have decided to continue with visualizing the different aspects of life of Americans with different occupations. We are continuing to visualize the occupations with one home screen from which the user can choose which occupation to view and then be presented with a page of visualized data about that occupation.

We found some data that was easily convertible to excel or csv files and have already converted those to graphs. Other data has a more complicated extraction process.

## 2. Key Questions
In terms of mining data, we would like help dealing with uncomplied data sources. For example, using the IPUMS extraction tool and using ATUS microfiles.

## 3. Agenda
For this review, we plan to give a terse debrief on our progress thus far with the help of our PowerPoint. During this time, we will explain the information on the PowerPoint in greater depth. We expect this part of the Review to last 10-15 minutes.
Based on the last architecture review, we expect that the reviewers will want to engage directly with us. Therefore, for the second part of the review, we intend to have a discussion with the reviewers. Also based on how the last review went, we have decided to pose each question, one after the other.
