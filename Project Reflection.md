# Project Reflection

### Feedback and Decisions
Majority of people suggested pygame for interactive component of the window. Furthermore, many people recommended matplotlib, seaborn, and bokeh for data visualization.

For data research, our peers recommended Statistica, US Census Bureau, Kaggle, and World Happiness Report. They also stated that if we don't find the sufficient data, we should stick with available data rather than struggle to look for possibly nonexistent data.

Based on the feedback, we have decided to use pygame for the interactive element of the window and a combination of matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization. We hope that the two libraries would be sufficient enough to represent necessary data. We also plan to use the existing data from US Census Bureau.

One question that was produced from the review was to figure out how to represent subjective data using data visualization libraries.

### Review Process Reflection:
The review went smoothly as we have hoped and planned. We hoped that we could get more suggestions for interactive elements other than pygame, but the majority suggested pygame. We could have focused our presentation more on the issues that we are facing rather than the background information of our project.
