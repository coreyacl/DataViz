# Preparation and Framing
### *Corey Cochran-Lepiz, Junwon Lee, and Alli Busa*

## 1. Background and context
Our goal is to create an interactive data visualization that represents the lives of Americans with different occupations. We want our visualization to start with a group of people on the screen which the user then clicks to zoom into that person and gain insight on what type of life they live through several metrics including:
- Happiness
- Income
- Avg. family size
- Avg. life span
- location? (compare off of "doctors near me" type search; registration location?)
- hrs work per week
- \# of people who have those jobs  

Our visualization will initially focus on 5-7 occupations, including plumber and corn farmer.
