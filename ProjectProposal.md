# Project Proposal

### 1. Big Idea.
##### MVP:
An interactive data visualization that starts with a group of people (data focused on the U.S.) on the screen which the user then clicks to zoom into that person and gain insight on what type of life they live through several metrics including:
- Happiness
- Income
- Avg. family size
- Avg. life span
- location? (compare off of "doctors near me" type search; registration location?)
- hrs work per week
- \# of people who have those jobs  

The occupations/walks of life we want to focus on are:
- Heart Doctors   
- Corn farmer
- Accountant
- Software Engineer
- Mechanical Engineer
- Physicist
- Plumber (Electrician?)

##### Stretch Goal:
Find a way to make it more interactive or visual with possibly more data. Some things include:
- Sentiment analysis of how others describe that profession
- Show contrasting environments for the same jobs
- Being able to click on items that you see in the zoom-in

### 2. Learning Goals
__Junwon__: Learn how to collect data using python, and how to write more concise code.

__Alli__: Learn how to extract data from website to sheet, and learn techniques on how to visualize data.

__Corey__: Learn how to effectively interface python with google sheets and how to visualize data.

### 3. Implementation Plan
Integrate google sheets using the google API, and use another package as the framework to visualize the data.

### 4. Project Schedule
Spend the first week scavenging for data on the Internet since our project is very data-dependent. Spend the second week learning the packages we intend to use then try and get the MVP done by the end of the fourth week.

### 5. Collaboration Plan
Work independently but together.

### 6. Risks
Not finding data.

### 7. Additional Course Content
Resources for how to create aesthetically pleasing content.
