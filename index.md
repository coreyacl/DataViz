## Our Goal

Ever wonder how cool seeing different types of data can be? Visualizing data can show you what something in the world is like more comprehensively and accurately than your personal experiences can. 
We did too! Through our endevours we aim to answer these questions:

- Are there any glaring disparities between types of occupations?
- Is there anything we can tell about how a person's way of life differs by occupation factors like location or free time?

## Our Intermediate Results

Right now, we have graphs that represent our data, like this one:

More Graphs can be found in the [about our code section](./AboutOurCode.md)

We also have a User Interface that takes the graphs we have, and presents them to the user via Pygame:
